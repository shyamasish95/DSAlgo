            To convert a number from binary to decimal, we have to get the LSB
            (Least Significant Bit) and MSB(Most Significant Bit). The Right most
            bit is LSB and the Left MOst bit is MSB in any given binary num.
            Eg: 110
            Here 0 is LSB
            and 1 is MSB

            FORMULA : 0*(2^0)+1*(2^1)+1*(2^2) = 2+4 = 6
            We start from LSB and move towards MSB
